# ðŸ”¬ Prostate Cancer RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains Python code and R Studio scripts used for processing and analyzing RNA-seq datasets related to prostate cancer. The datasets explored are **GSE140440**, **GSE150807**, and **GSE83654**. The goal is to identify differentially expressed genes and IL-27 related therapeutic targets using DESeq2, GO/KEGG enrichment. Pre-Procsessing is an important step that is included in the code included.
